## 1. Executive Summary

India's national AI ecosystem depends on high-quality, trustworthy health research datasets. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has developed MIDAS 2.0 (Metric-based Integrity and Data Assessment System) — a rigorous, evidence-based framework for evaluating health research datasets across 15 quality domains, producing a Composite Quality Index (CQI) and a Privacy-Risk Score (PRS). However, MIDAS 2.0 is a manual, institution-facing process. It cannot be directly integrated into AIKosh — India's national AI dataset repository — in its current form.

This document defines the requirements for the **AIKosh Dataset Quality Evaluation Toolkit**: a **browser-first, full-stack web application** that operationalises the MIDAS 2.0 framework. Dataset custodians log in via the web UI, upload health research datasets, fill in a structured metadata form, and receive a comprehensive quality report across all 15 MIDAS domains — including a CQI, PRS, release classification, and downloadable audit report. AIKosh and other external platforms integrate programmatically via REST API, submitting datasets using API keys and receiving quality metadata via webhook on assessment completion.

The toolkit is not a replacement for ICMR's official MIDAS certification process. It is the **automated pre-assessment and continuous quality layer** that brings MIDAS-grade intelligence into the AIKosh dataset lifecycle.

---

## 2. Background & Context

### 2.1 What is AIKosh

AIKosh is the national AI dataset and model repository under India's IndiaAI Mission, housed at `aikosh.indiaai.gov.in`. It is one of seven strategic pillars of the IndiaAI Mission, approved by Cabinet in March 2024. As of early 2026, it hosts over 10,000 datasets across 20 sectors including health, agriculture, education, and governance.

AIKosh provides:
- A centralised, searchable repository of anonymised, India-relevant datasets
- API-based access for developers and researchers
- An AI Sandbox (integrated development environment) for model training and experimentation
- Standardised metadata submission and licensing management
- An open Expression of Interest (EOI) process for dataset contribution

All submissions to AIKosh are validated through both automated and manual backend processes prior to publication. Artefacts must be submitted with complete metadata, licensing information, and descriptive documentation.

### 2.2 What is MIDAS 2.0

MIDAS 2.0 (Metric-based Integrity and Data Assessment System) is a framework developed by ICMR to evaluate the quality, trustworthiness, and AI-readiness of **health research datasets** — data collected specifically for research purposes such as clinical trials, cohort studies, epidemiological surveys, biomedical registries, and observational studies. It is explicitly distinct from healthcare operational data (EHRs, hospital records, claims).

MIDAS 2.0 was developed as an upgrade over MIDAS 1.0, which was originally focused on medical imaging datasets. MIDAS 2.0 extends to multimodal biomedical and health data including tabular, text, voice, imaging, and EHR-linked datasets.

It evaluates datasets across **15 quality domains**, producing two output scores:
- **Composite Quality Index (CQI):** 0–100 scale, overall dataset quality
- **Privacy-Risk Score (PRS):** 0–100 scale, residual re-identification risk

Together, CQI and PRS determine a dataset's release classification: Open, Controlled, or Restricted.

### 2.3 The Integration Gap

MIDAS 2.0 is a **human-in-the-loop, institution-facing process** with two stages:

1. **Lite Version** — self-assessment completed by the dataset custodian (Independent Centre)
2. **Technical Version** — independent validation and final score computation by a Nodal Centre

This manual, two-party workflow cannot be directly plugged into AIKosh's automated dataset onboarding pipeline. There is:
- No public API for MIDAS assessment submission
- No programmatic scoring engine
- No GitHub repository or open-source implementation
- No machine-readable version of the framework

AIKosh currently performs generic metadata validation and manual compliance review, but has no mechanism to generate MIDAS-grade quality intelligence automatically.

### 2.4 The IndiaAI–ICMR MoU Context

In May 2026, IndiaAI and ICMR signed a Memorandum of Understanding establishing a structured collaboration. Under this MoU, ICMR committed to contributing anonymised, ethics-approved health research datasets, AI models, and toolkits developed under the MIDAS framework to AIKosh. This MoU explicitly acknowledges that MIDAS and AIKosh are complementary systems and that integration work is required to operationalise MIDAS assessments within AIKosh workflows.

The AIKosh Dataset Quality Evaluation Toolkit is the practical realisation of this integration commitment.

## 3. MIDAS 2.0 Knowledge Extraction

> This section documents everything publicly known about MIDAS 2.0, extracted from `midas.icmr.org.in`. It forms the factual foundation for all scoring logic in this toolkit.

### 3.1 Framework Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Full Name | Metric-based Integrity and Data Assessment System 2.0 |
| Owner | Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) |
| Target Data | Health research datasets (not healthcare operational data) |
| Number of Domains | 15 |
| Scoring Outputs | CQI (0–100) + PRS (0–100) |
| Assessment Versions | Lite Version (self-assessment) + Technical Version (nodal validation) |
| Per-Domain Scale | 0–4 (0 = absent, 4 = exemplary) |
| Max Raw Score | 60 (15 domains × 4) |
| Performance Bands | 6 tiers (Remediation → Diamond) |
| Release Classes | Open / Controlled / Restricted |
| Public URL | https://midas.icmr.org.in |
| GitHub | None — no public codebase exists |

### 3.2 The Two-Stage Assessment Pathway

**Stage 1 — Lite Version (Self-Assessment by Independent Centre)**
- Dataset custodian performs structured self-assessment against 15 domains
- Uses simplified scoring options and ladders aligned to the Technical Version
- Custodian must retain all supporting evidence (SOPs, metadata, consent records, validation logs) for verification
- Produces a CQI-Lite and PRS-Lite (preliminary scores)
- Submitted to Nodal Centre for Stage 2

**Stage 2 — Technical Version (Validation by Nodal Centre)**
- Independent Nodal Centre verifies all Lite Version claims
- Requests clarifications or additional documentation where needed
- Applies detailed metrics, computation steps, and evidence-based validation
- Computes final CQI and PRS
- Recommends Open / Controlled / Restricted release classification
- Final report reviewed by Steering Committee before repository onboarding

### 3.3 The 15 Quality Domains (Complete)

All 15 domains are confirmed from the public Lite Version and Technical Version pages of midas.icmr.org.in. Each domain is scored 0–4 in both versions.

| # | Domain Name | Category | What It Measures |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Annotation / Labelling Reliability | Data Quality | Quality and reliability of labels/annotations produced by experts or trained readers |
| 2 | Metadata Completeness | Data Quality | Rich, machine-actionable metadata with persistent identifiers to enable discovery and reuse |
| 3 | Documentation & User Guidance | Data Quality | Clarity and depth of human-readable documentation for context, methods, and reuse |
| 4 | Population Representativeness | Data Quality | How well the dataset reflects the intended population across sites, regions, age, sex, and other axes |
| 5 | Data Structure & Interoperability | Operational Readiness | Mapping to healthcare standards and automated data-quality checks: conformance, completeness, plausibility |
| 6 | AI / Analytics Readiness | Operational Readiness | Packaging for benchmarking and safeguards against data leakage and distribution shift |
| 7 | Privacy & Identifiability | Trust Safeguards | Risk that individuals can be re-identified or sensitive attributes can be inferred |
| 8 | Security & Access Governance | Trust Safeguards | Demonstrable operational security and auditability of access to data and systems |
| 9 | Provenance & Workflow Transparency | Trust Safeguards | End-to-end trace from raw data to release, with executable pipelines |
| 10 | Ethical & Social Accountability | Trust Safeguards | Processes for equity impact, stakeholder engagement, and redressal |
| 11 | Synthetic / Simulated Data *(if applicable)* | Trust Safeguards | Utility and privacy of synthetic data relative to real data |
| 12 | Stewardship & Governance | Trust Safeguards | Organisational readiness and compliance for responsible data stewardship |
| 13 | Model Linkage Integrity | Operational Readiness | Traceable and verifiable linkages between datasets and any released models |
| 14 | Environmental Sustainability | Operational Readiness | Measurement and management of energy and carbon footprints from storage and compute |
| 15 | Continuous Curation & Feedback | Operational Readiness | Release cadence, user feedback integration, and versioning discipline |

**Note on Domain 11:** Domain 11 (Synthetic / Simulated Data) is marked "if applicable." When a dataset contains no synthetic or simulated data, the CQI denominator is reduced to 56 (14 × 4) and the formula adjusted accordingly.

**Domain Groupings (from MIDAS 2.0 homepage):**
- **Data Quality (Domains 1–4):** Annotation fidelity, metadata, documentation, and completeness
- **Operational Readiness (Domains 5–6, 13–15):** Interoperability, AI-readiness, representativeness, sustainability
- **Trust Safeguards (Domains 7–12):** Governance, ethics, security, consent, and privacy risk

### 3.4 Scoring Methodology — Composite Quality Index (CQI)

**Per-Domain Scoring Ladder:**
Each domain is scored on a 0–4 ordinal ladder:
- **0** — Absent: No evidence of this quality dimension exists
- **1** — Minimal: Basic evidence exists but significantly incomplete
- **2** — Partial: Moderate implementation with notable gaps
- **3** — Adequate: Substantial compliance with minor gaps
- **4** — Exemplary: Fully implemented, well-evidenced, best-practice standard

Scoring rule: *"Use the highest level score where all statements are true. If any statement at that level is missing, step down one level."*

**CQI Formula (publicly available):**

```
CQI = (Sum of domain scores / 60) × 100
```

Where:
- Sum of domain scores = total points across all 15 domains (or 14 if Domain 11 is not applicable)
- Maximum possible = 60 (standard) or 56 (if Domain 11 is N/A)
- If Domain 11 is N/A: CQI = (Sum / 56) × 100

**CQI Performance Bands (6-Tier Grading):**

| Band | CQI Range | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Diamond | ≥ 95 | Global exemplar |
| Platinum | 85–94 | Best-practice dataset |
| Gold | 70–84 | High-quality dataset |
| Silver | 50–69 | Permissible, needs improvement |
| Bronze | 25–49 | Embargoed for enhancement |
| Remediation | < 25 | Iterative QA required |

### 3.5 Scoring Methodology — Privacy-Risk Score (PRS)

The PRS estimates residual re-identification risk after privacy protections have been applied. It is calculated separately from the CQI and scored on a 0–100 scale.

**PRS Bands:**

| Band | PRS Range |
|---|---|
| Low | 0–15 |
| Moderate | 16–40 |
| High | 41–70 |
| Very High | 71–100 |

**PRS Calculation — publicly available baseline formulas:**

For tabular data:
```
BaselineRisk_tabular = 100 × p
(where p = estimated re-identification probability)
```

For data with Differential Privacy:
```
BaselineRisk_DP = min(100, 20 × ε)
(where ε = differential privacy epsilon parameter)
```

The baseline is then adjusted for data sensitivity class. MIDAS 2.0 defines sensitivity multipliers for data types (from the Lite Version Annexure I, partially public):

| Sensitivity Class | Examples | Multiplier |
|---|---|---|
| High Stigma / Personal Impact | TB, HIV, reproductive, mental-health, genomic, caste/tribe, violence | 1.5× |
| Critical / Safety-Sensitive | Forensic, detainee, conflict, tribal GPS, refugee, protest-related | 2.0× |
| Standard | General epidemiological, demographic, non-stigma health data | 1.0× |

**PRS identification risk scoring (from public snippets):**

| Scenario | Score |
|---|---|
| Names, phone numbers, IDs, GPS or full DOB still visible | 50 (Step 1 maximum) |
| Identifiers removed but unique event combinations could reveal identity | 30 |
| Only coarse info (age, sex, district, month) | 15 |
| Generalised categories (age bands, state, quarter); identities effectively hidden | 5 |

```
PRS = round(AdjustedRisk)
AdjustedRisk = BaselineRisk × SensitivityMultiplier
PRS = min(100, AdjustedRisk)
```

### 3.6 CQI × PRS Release Classification Matrix

| | PRS Low (0–15) | PRS Moderate (16–40) | PRS High (41–70) | PRS Very High (71–100) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CQI Diamond / Platinum (≥85)** | Open | Controlled | Restricted | Restricted |
| **CQI Gold (70–84)** | Open | Controlled | Restricted | Restricted |
| **CQI Silver (50–69)** | Controlled | Controlled | Restricted | Restricted |
| **CQI Bronze / Remediation (<50)** | Controlled | Restricted | Restricted | Restricted |

**Special policy rule:** Clinical-genomic or high-stigma data default to Controlled unless PRS is Low with strong, independently verified Differential Privacy.

### 3.7 Expert Validation (Delphi) Process

MIDAS 2.0 is currently undergoing expert validation through a Delphi review process before wider rollout. Experts rate each domain statement on a 1–5 clarity scale. Agreement thresholds:
- Item-level CVI (I-CVI) ≥ 0.78
- Scale-level CVI (S-CVI/Ave) ≥ 0.90
- Modified Kappa (k*) ≥ 0.74 (excellent consensus)

This means the framework is **not yet fully finalised** — which is an opportunity for this toolkit to be developed in alignment with the emerging final version.

### 3.8 What Is Not Publicly Available

The following aspects of MIDAS 2.0 are not publicly accessible and must be inferred or designed independently:

| Missing Element | Approach in Toolkit |
|---|---|
| Exact sub-criteria for each 0–4 score level per domain | Reverse-engineered from domain descriptions + health data quality literature |
| Exact weights per domain (if any differential weighting exists) | Equal weighting assumed (1/15 each) unless evidence of differential weights emerges |
| Full Annexure I PRS methodology | Partially reconstructed from public snippets; clearly marked as inferred |
| Internal inter-rater reliability protocols | Not required for automated system |
| Nodal Centre verification workflows | Replaced by automated evidence-based scoring |
| Exact CQI × PRS matrix boundaries | Reconstructed from public descriptions; marked as inferred |

## 4. AIKosh Platform Architecture Research

### 4.1 Platform Overview

AIKosh (`aikosh.indiaai.gov.in`) is a centralised platform under the IndiaAI Mission. It serves as a national repository of datasets, models, toolkits, use cases, and a sandbox (integrated development environment). As of early 2026, it hosts 10,000+ datasets across 20 sectors with contributors including IITs, Sarvam AI, AI4Bharat, and government ministries.

### 4.2 Current Dataset Onboarding Workflow

Based on the publicly available Expression of Interest (EOI) process:

1. Organisation registers on the AIKosh platform
2. Artefact submitted with complete metadata, licensing information, and descriptive documentation
3. Submission reviewed for platform compliance, ethical alignment, and technical completeness
4. Validation through both automated and manual backend processes
5. Publication on the platform

Current automated checks are generic — format compliance, metadata completeness against AIKosh schema, licensing validation. There is **no domain-specific quality assessment** for health research datasets.

### 4.3 API & Integration Capabilities

AIKosh provides:
- API-based access for dataset retrieval and model inference
- Secure API access with authentication
- AI Sandbox with an integrated development environment
- Standardised metadata schema for submission

The platform is designed to support toolkit and artefact contributions — the EOI explicitly invites toolkits as a contribution category.

### 4.4 What AIKosh Currently Lacks

- No MIDAS-grade quality scoring for health research datasets
- No automated CQI or PRS computation at submission time
- No quality badge or certification system displayed on dataset cards
- No structured feedback to submitters on quality gaps
- No release classification (Open/Controlled/Restricted) derived from quality + privacy scores

---

## 5. Gap Analysis — MIDAS vs AIKosh

| Dimension | MIDAS 2.0 (Current) | AIKosh (Current) | Toolkit (Proposed) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Assessment type | Manual, human-in-the-loop | Generic automated metadata check | Automated MIDAS-inspired domain scoring |
| Who assesses | Dataset custodian + Nodal Centre | AIKosh backend team | Toolkit engine (automated) |
| Output | CQI + PRS + Release class | Approval / Rejection | CQI + PRS + Release class + Structured report |
| Integration | Standalone ICMR process | AIKosh-native | AIKosh-native API |
| Turnaround | Days to weeks | Hours to days | Real-time (minutes) |
| Scalability | Low — requires human reviewers | Medium | High — fully automated |
| Health data specialisation | Yes — 15 health-specific domains | No — generic checks only | Yes — 15 domains implemented |
| Privacy scoring | Yes — PRS with sensitivity classes | No | Yes — automated PRS |
| Release classification | Yes — CQI × PRS matrix | No | Yes — automated matrix |
| Audit trail | Manual documentation | Basic logging | Full automated audit log |
| GitHub / API | None | Partial (retrieval only) | Full REST API |

**Core gap:** MIDAS is the assessment philosophy. AIKosh is the platform. Nothing currently bridges them with automation. This toolkit is that bridge.

---

## 6. Problem Statement

Health research datasets submitted to AIKosh currently undergo generic metadata and compliance checks, with no mechanism to assess their scientific quality, trustworthiness, representativeness, privacy risk, or AI-readiness in a structured, evidence-based, reproducible way.

MIDAS 2.0 — ICMR's gold-standard framework for exactly this purpose — cannot be integrated into AIKosh in its current form because it is a manual, institution-facing, human-in-the-loop process with no programmatic implementation.

As a result, AIKosh's health research dataset collection grows in volume without any systematic quality intelligence, making it difficult for researchers, startups, and innovators to identify which datasets are truly ready for AI development, safe for sharing, or require improvement before use.

---

## 7. Vision Statement

Build an automated, MIDAS-inspired Dataset Quality Evaluation Toolkit that is natively integrated into AIKosh, enabling any health research dataset uploaded to the platform to receive a comprehensive, reproducible quality assessment — including a Composite Quality Index, a Privacy-Risk Score, a release classification, and an actionable structured report — without requiring manual expert review for every submission.

> MIDAS 2.0 is the assessment philosophy.  
> AIKosh is the platform.  
> This toolkit is the automation layer that bridges them.

---

## 8. Goals

1. **Automate MIDAS 2.0 assessment** — Implement all 15 quality domains as automated, deterministic scoring rules applicable to uploaded health research datasets.

2. **Produce CQI and PRS** — Compute a Composite Quality Index (0–100) and a Privacy-Risk Score (0–100) for every assessed dataset, matching MIDAS 2.0's scoring structure.

3. **Generate release classification** — Apply the CQI × PRS matrix to output an Open / Controlled / Restricted recommendation for every dataset.

4. **Integrate with AIKosh** — Expose the toolkit as an API that plugs into AIKosh's dataset submission and metadata pipeline, returning quality scores as machine-readable metadata associated with each dataset.

5. **Generate structured quality reports** — Produce a downloadable, human-readable quality assessment report per dataset including domain scores, quality band, PRS band, release recommendation, and dimension-level observations.

6. **Provide a quality dashboard** — Surface quality scores, bands, and domain breakdowns in a visual interface accessible to dataset submitters and AIKosh administrators.

7. **Support both Lite and Technical assessment modes** — The toolkit replaces both stages: an automated Lite-mode run on upload, and a deeper automated Technical-mode analysis with stricter evidence thresholds.

8. **Be fully auditable** — All scoring decisions must be explainable and traceable to specific domain criteria and data observations, producing an audit log for every assessment.

---

## 9. Non-Goals

The following are explicitly out of scope:

- **Replacing official ICMR MIDAS certification** — Toolkit scores are quality intelligence, not official ICMR certification. Formal MIDAS certification still requires ICMR Nodal Centre validation.
- **AI model training** — No ML model is trained. The toolkit is entirely rule-based and deterministic.
- **Automated dataset remediation** — The toolkit identifies quality gaps but does not automatically fix datasets.
- **Recommendation engine** — No AI-generated improvement suggestions in the initial version. Gap identification is sufficient.
- **Non-health research datasets** — The toolkit is scoped to health research datasets only, not healthcare operational data or non-health domains.
- **General-purpose data quality tool** — This is not a generic data profiler. All domains and scoring logic are specific to MIDAS 2.0's health research context.
- **Real-time streaming data assessment** — Batch/file upload only.
- **Dataset version tracking** — Not in initial scope.
- **Benchmarking across datasets** — Comparative scoring across multiple datasets is future scope.

---

---

## 14. Proposed Solution Overview

The toolkit is an automated quality evaluation engine that:

1. **Accepts** a health research dataset upload (file + metadata form)
2. **Profiles** the dataset structure, completeness, schema, and provenance metadata
3. **Evaluates** the dataset against all 15 MIDAS domains using deterministic, automated scoring rules
4. **Computes** a CQI (domain scores summed and normalised to 0–100)
5. **Computes** a PRS (re-identification risk baseline + sensitivity adjustment)
6. **Classifies** the dataset release level using the CQI × PRS matrix
7. **Generates** a structured quality report (JSON + PDF/HTML)
8. **Returns** machine-readable quality metadata to AIKosh via REST API
9. **Stores** the assessment with a full audit log

The toolkit is a **rule-based, deterministic scoring engine** — not a machine learning model. Every score is explainable and traceable to specific domain criteria and data observations. This makes scores auditable and defensible in a government/research context.

**Outputs:** S3 key references and metadata JSON registered in PostgreSQL and passed to the profiling task.

---

### 17.2 Dataset Profiling Engine

**Purpose:** Generate a comprehensive statistical and structural profile of the dataset to feed into domain scoring.

**Profile Components:**

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Row / column count | Total records and features |
| Column-level completeness | Missing value % per column |
| Data type inference | Numeric, categorical, date, free text, binary |
| Value distribution summary | Mean, median, std, min, max per numeric column |
| Categorical cardinality | Unique value counts per categorical column |
| Duplicate row detection | Exact and near-duplicate % |
| Schema consistency | Are all records conformant to the inferred schema? |
| Outlier detection | Statistical outlier % per numeric column (IQR method) |
| Identifier presence detection | Heuristic check for name-like, phone-like, ID-like columns |
| Date range extraction | Earliest and latest dates in temporal columns |
| Encoding quality | UTF-8 compliance, character anomalies |
| File-level metadata extraction | File size, format, hash (SHA-256) |

**Output:** Dataset Profile JSON — referenced by all 15 domain scoring modules.

---

### 17.3 Quality Assessment Engine (15 Domains)

**Purpose:** Score each of the 15 MIDAS domains on a 0–4 scale using automated rules derived from the dataset profile and metadata form.

Each domain scorer is an independent module. All 15 run in parallel. Each produces:
- A score (0–4)
- A scoring rationale string (one per criterion checked)
- A list of evidence items that supported the score
- A list of gaps that prevented a higher score
- A confidence level (High / Medium / Low) indicating how much of the scoring was based on direct data observation vs. metadata form responses

**Note:** Domains 1, 4, 9, 10, and 12 are partially dependent on metadata form responses (evidence that cannot be inferred from the file alone). The confidence level field distinguishes direct-observation scoring from metadata-form-reliant scoring.

See Section 18 for the full domain-by-domain automated metric specification.

---

### 17.4 CQI Calculation Engine

**Purpose:** Aggregate the 15 domain scores into a single Composite Quality Index.

**Logic:**
```python
def compute_cqi(domain_scores: dict, domain_11_applicable: bool) -> float:
    total_score = sum(domain_scores.values())
    max_possible = 60 if domain_11_applicable else 56
    cqi = (total_score / max_possible) * 100
    return round(cqi, 1)

def get_cqi_band(cqi: float) -> str:
    if cqi >= 95:   return "Diamond"
    if cqi >= 85:   return "Platinum"
    if cqi >= 70:   return "Gold"
    if cqi >= 50:   return "Silver"
    if cqi >= 25:   return "Bronze"
    return "Remediation"
```

**Output:** CQI value (0–100, 1 decimal), CQI band, domain score breakdown.

---

### 17.5 PRS Calculation Engine

**Purpose:** Compute the Privacy-Risk Score based on re-identification risk and sensitivity class.

**Inputs from dataset profile and metadata form:**
- De-identification method applied
- Presence of direct identifiers (from profiler's heuristic scan)
- Remaining quasi-identifiers (age, sex, location granularity, date granularity)
- Differential Privacy epsilon (if applicable)
- Sensitivity class (standard / high stigma / critical)

**Logic:**
```python
def compute_baseline_risk(deidentification_info: dict, profile: dict) -> float:
    if profile["direct_identifiers_detected"]:
        return 50.0  # Maximum Step 1 score — identifiers present
    
    location_granularity = deidentification_info["location_granularity"]
    temporal_granularity = deidentification_info["temporal_granularity"]
    
    if location_granularity == "village" and profile["rare_condition"]:
        return 30.0
    if location_granularity in ["district", "month"]:
        return 15.0
    if location_granularity in ["state", "region"]:
        return 5.0
    
    # Differential Privacy path
    if deidentification_info.get("differential_privacy_applied"):
        epsilon = deidentification_info["epsilon"]
        return min(100, 20 * epsilon)
    
    return 15.0  # Default moderate

SENSITIVITY_MULTIPLIERS = {
    "standard": 1.0,
    "high_stigma": 1.5,   # TB, HIV, mental health, genomic, etc.
    "critical": 2.0        # Forensic, conflict, detainee, refugee, etc.
}

def compute_prs(baseline_risk: float, sensitivity_class: str) -> int:
    multiplier = SENSITIVITY_MULTIPLIERS.get(sensitivity_class, 1.0)
    adjusted = baseline_risk * multiplier
    return min(100, round(adjusted))

def get_prs_band(prs: int) -> str:
    if prs <= 15:   return "Low"
    if prs <= 40:   return "Moderate"
    if prs <= 70:   return "High"
    return "Very High"
```

**Output:** PRS value (0–100, integer), PRS band.

---

### 17.6 Release Classification Engine

**Purpose:** Apply the CQI × PRS matrix to determine dataset release classification.

**Logic:**
```python
def classify_release(cqi: float, prs: int, sensitivity_class: str) -> str:
    prs_band = get_prs_band(prs)
    cqi_band = get_cqi_band(cqi)
    
    # Special policy override
    if sensitivity_class in ["high_stigma", "critical"]:
        if prs_band != "Low":
            return "Restricted"
        # Even with Low PRS, high-stigma defaults to Controlled
        # unless Differential Privacy is verified
        return "Controlled"
    
    # Standard matrix
    if cqi >= 70 and prs_band == "Low":
        return "Open"
    if cqi >= 70 and prs_band == "Moderate":
        return "Controlled"
    if prs_band in ["High", "Very High"]:
        return "Restricted"
    if cqi < 50:
        return "Controlled" if prs_band == "Low" else "Restricted"
    
    return "Controlled"
```

**Output:** Release classification (Open / Controlled / Restricted) with justification string.

---

### 17.7 Report Generation Module

**Purpose:** Generate a structured assessment report in multiple formats.

**Report Contents:**
- Assessment metadata (dataset name, submission date, assessment ID, toolkit version)
- Dataset profile summary
- Domain-by-domain scores (0–4) with rationale and evidence
- CQI value, band, and formula trace
- PRS value, band, and computation trace
- Release classification and justification
- Quality gap summary (domains scoring 0–2)
- Strengths summary (domains scoring 3–4)
- Audit log reference

**Output Formats:**
- Structured JSON (primary — consumed by AIKosh API)
- HTML report (human-readable, self-contained)
- PDF (generated from HTML)

---

### 17.8 Dashboard & Visualisations
 
 **Purpose:** Provide a visual interface for custodians and administrators to review assessment results.
 
 **Dashboard Elements:**
 - **Radar / Spider Chart:** 15-domain score visualisation
 - **CQI Gauge:** 0–100 gauge with band colour coding
 - **PRS Gauge:** 0–100 gauge with band colour coding
 - **Release Class Badge:** Open (green) / Controlled (amber) / Restricted (red)
 - **Domain Score Table:** All 15 domains with score, max, rationale, confidence level
 - **Gap Identification Panel:** Domains below 2, sorted by score ascending
 - **Score History:** CQI and PRS trend across assessment versions (for re-assessments)
 - **Transparent Failure Panel:** If the background evaluation job fails (reaches `failed` status), the dashboard must display a clear, human-readable description of the error and traceback to the user for transparent debugging and self-correction (e.g., file parse failures, format mismatches, or missing parameters).

---

### 17.9 AIKosh Integration Layer

**Purpose:** Return quality metadata to AIKosh's dataset record system via REST API.

**Integration Pattern:**
- Toolkit exposes a REST API endpoint
- AIKosh calls the endpoint at dataset submission time with dataset file + metadata
- Toolkit runs assessment asynchronously and POSTs results back to a AIKosh webhook
- AIKosh stores quality metadata as structured fields on the dataset record
- Quality badges (CQI band, PRS band, release class) rendered on dataset catalog card

**Quality Metadata Schema returned to AIKosh:**
```json

| `/api/v1/datasets/{dataset_id}/assessments` | GET | List all assessments for a dataset |
| `/api/v1/health` | GET | Health check |

### Authentication
- **Dual Authentication Model:**
  - **User Session Auth:** Secure `HttpOnly` cookie-based JWT session for browser human logins (Sign-Up / Sign-In / Log-Out pages on the React UI).
  - **Developer API Key Auth:** Header-based API Key (`Authorization: Bearer <key>`) for programmatic integration and automated scripts.
- **Admin Access Boundaries:** Admin users can list and manage user accounts but cannot view or download user datasets or access sensitive assessment reports.

### Async Pattern
- `/api/v1/assess` returns immediately with `assessment_id` and `status: processing`
- Client polls `/api/v1/assess/{assessment_id}` or receives webhook callback when complete
- Typical processing time < 3 minutes for datasets ≤ 1GB

### AIKosh Webhook
- Toolkit POSTs quality metadata JSON to AIKosh-provided webhook URL on completion
- Includes `dataset_id` for AIKosh to associate results with the dataset record

## 21. Data Flow

1. **Upload:** Client requests a pre-signed S3 upload URL, uploads the dataset file directly to MinIO/S3, and submits the metadata form containing the S3 file key to FastAPI.
2. **Validation:** Format check, size check, encoding check verified by the backend profiling task → fail assessment if invalid.
3. **Storage:** File stored in secure object storage (encrypted at rest).
4. **Profiling:** Profiling engine reads file from S3, generates Dataset Profile JSON.
5. **Assessment:** 15 domain scorers run in parallel against Profile JSON + metadata form.
6. **Aggregation:** CQI engine aggregates domain scores; PRS engine computes privacy risk.
7. **Classification:** Release classification engine applies matrix.
8. **Report:** Report generator produces JSON report + renders HTML/PDF.
9. **Integration:** Quality metadata POSTed to AIKosh webhook.
10. **Storage:** Assessment record + report + audit log persisted in PostgreSQL and object storage.
11. **Cleanup:** Dataset file retained in object storage until manually deleted by the user via the UI/API.

- AIKosh webhook integration tested with mock AIKosh endpoint
- API contract tests (all endpoints against OpenAPI spec)

### Quality Framework Validation
- Run toolkit against real health research datasets from AIKosh, NDAP, and PhysioNet
- Compare automated scores to manual MIDAS-inspired expert assessment
- CQI accuracy target: ±5 points; PRS accuracy target: ±10 points

### Performance Testing
- Load test with 100 concurrent submissions (datasets of varying sizes: 10MB, 100MB, 1GB)
- Verify processing time < 3 minutes at p95

### Security Testing
- OWASP API security top 10 validation
- File upload security: malicious file rejection, path traversal prevention
- Penetration test on API endpoints

### Regression Testing
- Full assessment suite run on every deployment to catch scoring regressions
- Golden dataset suite (fixed datasets with known expected scores)

12. Security: no critical or high-severity vulnerabilities in final security scan
13. Unit test coverage ≥ 80% across scoring engine modules

---

## 28. Risks & Limitations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| MIDAS 2.0 scoring criteria change post-Delphi review | Medium | High | Design framework as configuration-driven; domain criteria defined in YAML config files, not hardcoded |
| Automated scoring cannot fully replicate expert human judgment | High | Medium | Clearly communicate scores are automated estimates, not official MIDAS certification; provide confidence levels |
| Domain 1 (Annotation) scoring limited for datasets with no annotation columns | High | Low | Score based on metadata form responses; flag low confidence where file-based evidence unavailable |
| Domains relying on metadata form may produce inflated scores if custodian over-reports | Medium | High | Flag metadata-form-heavy domains with lower confidence; require evidence attachments for high scores on critical domains |
| AIKosh API integration specifications not fully public | Medium | High | Build integration layer with configurable webhook URL and payload schema; design for easy adaptation |
| Large datasets (>5GB) exceed processing time targets | Medium | Low | Implement sampling-based profiling for large files; clearly disclose sampling in reports |
| Privacy-sensitive data uploaded to toolkit | Medium | High | Keep files in secure private object storage under strict tenant isolation, and allow users to manually delete raw files and reports at any time |
| ICMR objects to toolkit claiming MIDAS alignment | Low | High | Clearly label as "MIDAS-inspired"; do not claim official MIDAS certification; document all inferences |

---

## 29. Assumptions Log

| # | Assumption | Confidence | If Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Equal domain weighting (1/15 each) | Medium | Update when official weights published |
| A2 | CQI formula: (sum/60)×100 is as stated on MIDAS website | High | Confirmed from public source |
| A3 | PRS bands (0–15/16–40/41–70/71–100) are as stated | High | Confirmed from public Lite Version |
| A4 | Sensitivity multipliers (1.0×/1.5×/2.0×) are as documented in public Lite Version snippets | High | Adjust per full Annexure I if obtained |
| A5 | Domain 13 scores 3 (neutral) when no models are linked | Medium | Adjust if MIDAS clarifies this should be N/A |
| A6 | Kappa thresholds for Domain 1 are 0.6 and 0.8 | Medium | Adjust to match official sub-criteria if released |
| A7 | Column completeness ≥ 90% maps to Score 3 in Domain 5 | Medium | Adjust per official FHIR/health data completeness standards |
| A8 | MIDAS 2.0 is in its final public form post-Delphi review | Low | Framework may change; design scoring as config-driven |

## Appendix C — PRS Calculation Worked Example

**Dataset:** Multi-site TB Cohort Study

**Step 1 — Identifier Risk Assessment:**
- Direct identifiers detected by profiler: None
- Location granularity: District level
- Temporal granularity: Month of diagnosis
- Rare condition + village + date combination: No (district-level, not village)
- Baseline risk from identification: **15** (only coarse info: age, sex, district, month)

**Step 2 — Sensitivity Class:**
- TB data → High Stigma / Personal Impact → multiplier = **1.5×**

**Step 3 — PRS Computation:**
```
AdjustedRisk = 15 × 1.5 = 22.5
PRS = round(22.5) = 23 ≈ 22 (rounded)
PRS Band = Moderate (16–40)
```

**Step 4 — Release Classification:**
- TB is high-stigma → defaults to Controlled regardless of PRS band
- Release classification: **Controlled**
