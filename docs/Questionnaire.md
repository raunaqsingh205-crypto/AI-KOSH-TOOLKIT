## Purpose of This Document

The Metadata Intake Form is the structured questionnaire shown to dataset custodians when they submit a health research dataset to the AIKosh Quality Toolkit. It collects information that cannot be inferred from the dataset file alone — context about how the data was collected, annotated, de-identified, governed, and documented.

**Why this form exists:** The dataset file (CSV, XLSX, etc.) tells the toolkit *what* the data contains. The form tells it *how* the data was created, who collected it, what protections were applied, and how it is managed. Without the form, Domains 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15 cannot be scored at all, and Domains 2, 7, and 11 can only be partially scored.

**Important note on sourcing:** MIDAS 2.0 does not publicly release its exact questionnaire wording. Every question in this form has been reverse-engineered from the 15 MIDAS domain descriptions, MIDAS scoring criteria, and health data quality literature. Where a question maps directly to a confirmed MIDAS criterion, it is marked `[MIDAS-CONFIRMED]`. Where it is inferred, it is marked `[INFERRED]`.
